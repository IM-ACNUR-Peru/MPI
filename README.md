# MPI

The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) developed by Sabina Alkire and James Foster is a widely recognized measure of poverty that goes beyond income-based indicators. The MPI assesses poverty based on multiple dimensions, such as health, education, and standard of living. It identifies individuals who are simultaneously deprived in multiple aspects of their lives, providing a more comprehensive understanding of poverty. The MPI assigns a deprivation score to each individual and aggregates these scores to calculate the overall poverty rate. It is a valuable tool for policymakers and researchers to design targeted interventions and monitor progress in poverty reduction efforts.
